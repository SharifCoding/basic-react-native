## Learning React Native
Six challenges to get you started with React Native, [source](https://share.viget.com/sxsw/learning-react-native/index.html). Credit to [Lawson Kurtz](https://gitlab.com/ltk).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

#### [Challenge 1: Zero to Hero](./challenges/Zero_to_Hero.md)
The goal of this challenge it to initialise your first React Native app, and get it running on a device using Expo.

#### [Challenge 2: Simulator Orientation](./challenges/Simulator_Orientation.md)
The goal of this challenge it to become comfortable with light debugging and the basic React Native dev tools. You’ll debug some errors, and then spend some time poking around the dev tools.

#### [Challenge 3: Straight Styling](./challenges/Straight_Styling.md)
The goal with this challenge is to gain familiarity with React Native’s style and layout capabilities.

#### [Challenge 4: Rockets](./challenges/Rockets.md)
Make an app with a button that fires a rocket. The button should have some sort of safety to prevent accidental launches.

#### [Challenge 5: Navigation](./challenges/Navigation.md)
Build an app that provides details about some popular venues.

#### [Challenge 6: Location](./challenges/Location.md)
Building on top of what you already made in Challenge 5, enhance your venue list by showing in real-time how far away the user is from each venue.

#### Installation
To run this project you will need to download it onto your local machine and install all dependencies.
Navigate inside the folder and install all dependencies by entering the following command on your terminal window:
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
```
Finally to run the server enter the following command in your terminal window:
```bash
# Runs your app in development mode.
npm start
```
Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal. Additionally:
```bash
# Open your app in the iOS Simulator on Mac platform.
npm run ios
# Open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
npm run android
```
